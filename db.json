QUIC](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344329901_PCM_Proactive_Connection_Migration_in_QUIC)\nQUIC provides a secure, reliable and low-latency communication foundation for HTTP. QUIC uses a 64 bits random number as the connection ID to uniquely determine a connection from client to server. After the user switches the network, the server recognizes the user request according to the connection ID and continues to provide services through the connection migration technology. However, the current connection migration is passive, which is used to support mobile handover and weak network scenarios. This paper proposes a Proactive Connection Migration (PCM) mechanism for QUIC. PCM gives QUIC the ability to select the optimal network in a heterogeneous network environment. Firstly, PCM actively perceives the different networks available to users. Then, PCM integrates the network quality exploration of different paths into the user’s multiple request actions. Finally, PCM takes response delay and jitter into account, and uses online learning to find the optimal network for current Internet service. Experimental results show that, compared with original QUIC, the average response delay of QUIC with PCM is reduced by 59.43% at most.\n","source":"article/index.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Latest Articles\n---\n<font size=2>\n\n###### [Connection Migration in QUIC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-tan-quic-connection-migration/)\nThis document explores and classifies QUIC connection migration, and suggests possible improvements.\n\n\n###### [PCM: Proactive Connection Migration in QUIC](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344329901_PCM_Proactive_Connection_Migration_in_QUIC)\nQUIC provides a secure, reliable and low-latency communication foundation for HTTP.
